# Feature Plan Template

Write a plan document with these sections:

## Problem Statement
1-2 sentences. What problem does this solve? Why now?

## Success Criteria
Measurable outcomes. How do we know it's working?

## User Stories / Use Cases
Who does what, and what do they expect?

## Requirements
- **Must Have**: Core functionality (MVP)
- **Should Have**: Important but not blocking
- **Could Have**: Nice to have, future consideration
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope

## Technical Considerations
- Systems affected
- Dependencies
- Data model changes
- API changes
- Security/privacy implications

## Risks & Mitigations
What could go wrong and how do we handle it?

## Open Questions
Anything still unresolved that needs answers before/during implementation

## Recommended Approach
Your recommendation with brief rationale. Note tradeoffs if alternatives exist.

## Code Examples / Architecture (Last)
Only after everything above is solid. Sketches, not implementation.
